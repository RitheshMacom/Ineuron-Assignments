ItÕs not thatshe objected to the purchase \\nÑ it was just so out of charac-ter for me to buy something like that on impulse... and\\nworse yet, from a TV infomercial! \\nSeveral days later, \\nThe Mental Bankprogram arrived at\\nmy doorstep.  And I was fascinated and excited to begin\\n\\nlearning how our thoughts determine the quality of our\\nlives.  Prior to that time, I had never heard these ideas.\\n\\nUnfortunately, they don\\nÕt teach you this stuff in school!\\nThe Mental Bankprogram spurred me to seek out other\\nmotivational resources.  I began to read books by Napoleon\\n\\nHill, Og Mandino, Norman Vincent Peale and Robert\\n\\nSchuller.  I started reading the Bible on a regular basis.  And\\n\\nI eagerly listened to inspiring audio cassette programs by\\n\\nZig Ziglar, Earl Nightingale and many others.
