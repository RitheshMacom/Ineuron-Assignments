1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Ans:-  Boolean data values are "True" and "False"
       They are written as True/False with first letter in capitals.
       
       
       

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?     

Ans:- 'AND' 'OR' and 'NOT' are the three types of boolean operators.




3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluates).

Ans:- "And" operator   "OR" operator      "NOT" operator
       T and T = T      T or T = T          A     not A
       T and F = F      T or F = T          
       F and T = F      F or T = T          T      F
       F and F = F      F or F = F          F      T
       
      Where T = True
            F = False
            
            
            
            
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans :- print((5 > 4) and (3 == 5))        [False]
       print(not (5 > 4))                 [False]
       print((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))         [True]
       print(not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)))   [False]
       
       
       
       
       
       
5. What are the six comparison operators?

Ans. For example a = 10 and b = 20
  == (Equals to) i.e. [a==b; false]
  != (not equals to) i.e. [a ! = b;  true]
  >   (greater than) i.e. [a>b ; false]
  <  (less than) i.e. [a<b; true]
  >= (greater than or equals to ) i.e.[a >= b ;false ]
  <= (less than or equals to ) i.e. [a <= b ; true]
  
  
  
  
  
  
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.

Ans:- Equal operator is ‘==’ evaluates the equality between operands
      Assignment operator ‘=’ assigns the value to a variable.
       
   For example :- x = 10
                  y = 45
                  z = 45 (we assigned values to variables)
                  
                  x == y (False because we assigned different values to x and y)
                  y == z (True because we assigned equal values to y and z)
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Ans:- spam = 0

FIRST BLOCK
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    
SECOND BLOCK    
if spam > 5:
    print('bacon')
    
THIRD BLOCK    
else:
    print('ham')
    print('spam')
    print('spam')
    
    
    
    

                 
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
 
Ans:- spam = int (input())
if spam >=1 and spam <=2:
    if spam==1:
        print ("Hello")
    elif spam==2:
        print ("Howdy")
else : 
    print("greetings")
    
    
    
    
    
    
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press? 

Ans:- ctrl + c 
     or may be we can create exit condition
     
     
     
     
     
     
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Ans:- Break takes the control out of the conditional loop or iteration.
      Continue takes the control to next loop or iteration in the conditional loop 
      
      
      
      
      
      
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Ans:-The output for all is same but the difference is way of writing the condition.






12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Ans:- for i in range(1,11):
           print(i)
                 
      i = 0
      while i <=10:
           print(i)
           i += 1 
           
           
           
           
           
           
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?   
 
Ans:- import spam

      spam.bacon()
